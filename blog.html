            <h1 class="font-bold">What is the Difference Between Var, Let & Const?</h1>
            <p class="py-4">var variables can be re-declared and updated.
                The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable
                that
                is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
            </p>

            <p class="py-4"> let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an
                improvement to var
                declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.
                let is block scoped.let can be updated but not re-declared.
            </p>

            <p class="py-4">
                Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities
                with let declarations.
                const declarations are block scoped.const cannot be updated or re-declared.

            <h1 class="font-bold">What is the difference between reguar function and arrow function?</h1>
            <p class="py-4">
                Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.
                Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow
                functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor
                functions.
            </p>

            <p class="py-4">
                Arrow functions do not have a arguments array
                In JS arguments array in functions is a special object that can be used to get all the arguments passed
                to the function. Similar to this, arrow functions do not have their own binding to a arguments object,
                they are bound to arguments of enclosing scope.

                Arrow functions are callable but not constructable
                If a function is constructable, it can be called with new, i.e. new User(). If a function is callable,
                it can be called without new (i.e. normal function call).

                Functions created through function declarations / expressions are both constructable and callable.

                Arrow functions (and methods) are only callable. class constructors are only constructable.

            <h1 class="font-bold">Differences Between map(), ForEach(), filter(), and find()?</h1>
            <p class="py-4">
                forEach:

                forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array
                and it returns undefined.
            </p>
            <p class="py-4">
                map():
                map(), executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated.
                elements.
            </p>
            <p class="py-4">
                filter():
                filter(), checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array
                with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
            </p>

            <p class="py-4">
                find:

                find(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array When we want to select a single
                element from an array..

            <h1 class="font-bold">Why we use template string?</h1>
            <p class="py-4">
                Template strings:

                Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings,
                for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.

                Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly
                for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged
                template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform
                whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
            </p>
